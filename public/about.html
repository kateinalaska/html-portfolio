<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I'm Kate. I have been learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for the last few
  years. I am now in a position in life where I can solely focus on coding. I'm
  looking forward to this web development journey.

  I moved to Alaska in 2022. I live with my fiance in the Kenai Peninsula. I
  really enjoy shooting my bow, hiking, cross country skiing, snowmachining,
  hunting, and being outside in general.
